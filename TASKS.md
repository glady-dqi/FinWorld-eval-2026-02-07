# FinWorld Evaluation Tasks (local board)

**Project board could not be created via GitHub API due to missing `project` scope.**
This file mirrors the requested workflow: BACKLOG → IN PROGRESS → REVIEW → DONE.

## BACKLOG
- [ ] Run example scripts/demos (requires full deps + APIs).
- [ ] Execute full test suite after successful install.

## IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Evaluate additional modules for reuse once dependencies resolve.

## REVIEW
- [ ] Verify report completeness vs checklist.

## DONE
- [x] Fork created: `glady-dqi/FinWorld-eval-2026-02-07` (local clone ready).
- [x] Repo scan (structure, configs, docs, tests).
- [x] Identify install methods (requirements.txt / pyproject.toml / poetry.lock).
- [x] Environment build attempted; logs captured (logs/install_pip.txt).
- [x] Tests attempted; result logged (logs/tests.txt).
- [x] Minimal sanity test added (tests/test_alpha158_sanity.py).
- [x] Technical Evaluation Report drafted (report/report.pdf).
