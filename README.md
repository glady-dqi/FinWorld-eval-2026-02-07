## 🎯 Research Contributions

Our main contributions are threefold:

1. **Unified Framework**: We propose a unified, end-to-end framework for training and evaluation of ML, DL, RL, LLMs, and LLM agents, covering four critical financial AI task types including time series forecasting, algorithmic trading, portfolio management, and LLM applications.

2. **Modular Design**: The framework features a modular architecture that enables flexible construction of custom models and tasks, including the development of personalized LLM agents. The system supports efficient distributed training and testing across multiple environments.

3. **Comprehensive Benchmark**: We provide support for multimodal heterogeneous data with over 800 million samples, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for the financial AI community. Extensive experiments across four task types demonstrate the framework's flexibility and effectiveness.

# Evaluation Summary (2026-02-07)

## Repo Summary
FinWorld is an ambitious end-to-end financial AI platform with modules spanning data acquisition, factor engineering, model training (ML/DL/RL/LLM), and evaluation. The architecture is modular with registries, configuration-driven experiments, and a broad set of tasks (forecasting, trading, portfolio, LLM reasoning). The repo appears to be a **preview version**; several components are present but may be incomplete or in flux.

## Build / Installation Results
- Attempted **pip install -r requirements.txt** in a clean venv.
- The install process began but was **stopped mid-way** due to extremely heavy dependencies (e.g., CUDA-enabled PyTorch, Playwright stack, RL/LLM toolchain).
- Partial log: `logs/install_pip.txt`.
- Many packages download correctly, but full installation is not feasible in a minimal CPU-only environment without GPU/CUDA and system dependencies.

## Tests
- Repo includes tests in `tests/`, but **pytest is not installed** by default.
- Attempt to run `pytest -q` failed: `pytest: command not found` (see `logs/tests.txt`).
- Added minimal sanity test: `tests/test_alpha158_sanity.py` (validates factor computation shapes).

## Code Quality & Documentation
- Structure is clean and modular; extensive folders for tasks, models, and utilities.
- Documentation is thorough in HTML docs and README.
- Many components appear to be stubs or heavy dependencies; this aligns with the "preview" warning in README.

## Relevance to AI Bubble Research
**Most relevant components:**
- `finworld/factor/alpha158.py`: rich factor engineering library (technical/factor features).
- `finworld/data` and `finworld/downloader`: multi-source data hooks (potentially useful, but require API keys).
- `finworld/metric` and `finworld/evaluator`: evaluation utilities.

**Less relevant:**
- Heavy RL/LLM agent pipelines, distributed training, and UI components.

## Integration Guide (AI Bubble Research)
Recommended integration path:
1. Use `Alpha158` factor generator to compute technical factor panels for AI vs non-AI baskets.
2. Feed factors into existing bubble diagnostics pipeline for residualization or exploratory regressions.
3. Avoid RL/LLM training layers unless needed (heavy dependencies).

Included demo:
- `scripts/integration_demo_alpha158.py`: builds synthetic OHLCV and computes Alpha158 factors.

## Recommendation
**PARTIALLY USEFUL**
- Valuable factor engineering and modular structure.
- Heavy dependencies and preview status limit immediate full adoption.
- Best used as a source of factor utilities, not as a turnkey platform for bubble diagnostics.
